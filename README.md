## Make your own

Clicking this button will clone the repo and deploy it to Netlify, be sure to rename your repo afterwards (and delete all of my personal redirects)!

You can add a link by running `npm run shorten websitelink path` where `websitelink` is the route you want to shorten, and `path` is the path that'll replace it. If you omit `path`, it'll give you a random string!
