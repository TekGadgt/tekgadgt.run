My own lil URL shortener

//TODO Add Netlify Status Button

## Make your own

Clicking this button will clone the repo and deploy it to Netlify, be sure to rename your repo afterwards (and delete all of my personal redirects)!

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/TekGadgt/tekgadgt.run&utm_source=github&utm_medium=shortener-cs&utm_campaign=devex)

You can add a link by running `npm run shorten websitelink path` where `websitelink` is the route you want to shorten, and `path` is the path that'll replace it. If you omit `path`, it'll give you a random string!
